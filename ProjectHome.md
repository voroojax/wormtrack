A Network IDS which allows detection of scanning worms on a Local Area Network by monitoring of anomalous ARP traffic.
This allows detection of scanning threats on the network, without having a privileged access on a Switch to set up a dedicated Monitor PORT, nor does it require a constant updating of the rules engine to address new threats.
